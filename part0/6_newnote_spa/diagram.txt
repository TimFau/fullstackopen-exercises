note over browser: 
User enters 'note' value in 'input' element.
User clicks the 'submit' button to submit the form.
code from spa.js:
- intercepts the form submit event.
- puts 'note' input value into an object with a new date.
- adds 'note' object to the 'notes' array.
- triggers redrawNotes function to render updated notes data to the DOM.
- triggers sendToServer to update json data.
end note
browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
note right of browser: 
input value is included in payload as 'content'.
date is included in payload as 'date'.
end note
server-->browser: {"message":"note created"}
note left of server:
Server sends response to let us know that the note was created.
This means that, if we refresh the page, data.json will contain the
new note and it will still be rendered to the DOM on refresh.
end note
